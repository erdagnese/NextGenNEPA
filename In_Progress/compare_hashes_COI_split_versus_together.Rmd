## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r import data}
fwd_hashes <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run2_rerun_20211013","COI_fwds_hash_key.csv"))
bkwd_hashes <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files","run2_rerun_20211013","COI_bkwds_hash_key.csv"))
all_hashes <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files","run2_rerun_20211008","COI_hash_key.csv"))

fwd_asvs <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files","run2_rerun_20211013","COI_fwds_ASV_table.csv"))
bkwd_asvs <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files","run2_rerun_20211013","COI_bkwds_ASV_table.csv"))
all_asvs <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files","run2_rerun_20211008","COI_ASV_table.csv"))
```

```{r qc}

## check sum of both 
nrow(all_hashes) - nrow(bkwd_hashes) - nrow(fwd_hashes)
# so if they are run separately, it finds more hashes than if you run them individually.... 

## also see how many asvs/reads in each sample for each way dada'd
all_stats <- 
  all_asvs %>% 
  group_by(Sample_name) %>%
  summarise(tot_asvs = n(), tot_reads = sum(nReads)) 

fwd_stats <- 
  fwd_asvs %>% 
  group_by(Sample_name) %>%
  summarise(tot_asvs = n(), tot_reads = sum(nReads)) 

bkwd_stats <- 
  bkwd_asvs %>% 
  group_by(Sample_name) %>%
  summarise(tot_asvs = n(), tot_reads = sum(nReads)) 

## check fragment lengths
hist(nchar(all_hashes$Sequence))
hist(nchar(bkwd_hashes$Sequence))
hist(nchar(fwd_hashes$Sequence))
# this is a variable fragment because of the degeneracies - they look similar so just leave them 

```

```{r now compare overlaps}
