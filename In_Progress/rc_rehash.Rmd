```

Because we are idiots, some samples were sequenced with the adapters/primers backwards. (MAJOR face palm.) We made life a lot harder for ourselves. 

So, to fix this, after dada2, we need to reverse complement the representative sequence from the dada2 output and then we ALSO have to "re-hash" because the hash ID corresponds to the sequence (so if we are using the RC of the sequence the hash id will be wrong). That way we can compare hashes from samples that the primers were put on backwards to samples where the primers were put on correctly. 

```{r load the files where primers/adapters were put on backwards}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(insect)
library(digest)

hash_key <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run1_20210527", "COI", "hash_key.csv"))
asv_table <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run1_20210527","COI", "ASV_table.csv"))
```


```{r reverse complement the representative sequences}
new_hash_key <- hash_key
rc_seq <- vector(length = dim(hash_key)[1])

# this is ridiculous and shouldn't be for loop but wtf i can't get it to work 
for (i in 1:dim(hash_key)[1]) {
  rc_seq[i] = rc(hash_key[i,2])
  }

new_hash_key$Sequence <- rc_seq
```

```{r now rehash}
# great - but now we need to rehash - be careful because there are different algorithms
new_hash_key$Hash <- sapply(new_hash_key$Sequence, digest, algo = "sha1", serialize = F, skip = "auto")

# then write the new hash key to a csv
write.csv(new_hash_key, here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run1_20210527", "COI", "new_hash_key.csv"))

```

```{r now change hashes in asv table and resave it}
old_to_new_hash_key <- data.frame(hash_key$Hash, new_hash_key$Hash)
colnames(old_to_new_hash_key) <- c("Hash", "NewHash")
new_asv_table <- inner_join(asv_table, old_to_new_hash_key) 
new_asv_table <- new_asv_table[, !(colnames(new_asv_table) %in% "Hash")]

new_asv_table %>% 
  rename(Hash = NewHash)

write.csv(new_asv_table, here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run1_20210527", "COI", "new_ASV_table.csv"))

```

CHECK TO MAKE SURE IT WORKED USING: 
run 1 (which was classified as RC) with the subset of run 2 samples that were run backwards
run 2 backwards and run 2 forwards

```{r test this by looking at forwards and backwards from run 2 rerun}
f_hash_key <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run2_rerun_20211013", "COI_fwds_hash_key.csv"))
f_asv_table <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run2_rerun_20211013", "COI_fwds_ASV_table.csv"))

b_hash_key <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run2_rerun_20211013", "COI_bkwds_200_175_hash_key.csv"))
b_asv_table <- read.csv(here("Output","dada2_output_files", "run2_rerun_20211013", "COI_bkwds_200_175_ASV_table.csv"))

b_new_hash_key <- b_hash_key
b_rc_seq <- vector(length = dim(b_hash_key)[1])

for (i in 1:dim(b_hash_key)[1]) {
  b_rc_seq[i] = rc(b_hash_key[i,2])
  }

b_new_hash_key$Sequence <- b_rc_seq
b_new_hash_key$Hash <- sapply(b_new_hash_key$Sequence, digest, algo = "sha1", serialize = F, skip = "auto")
b_new_asv_table <- b_asv_table

### these should all have overlap (without changing anything)
intersect(hash_key$Hash, b_hash_key$Hash)
intersect(hash_key$Sequence, b_hash_key$Sequence)

### these should now have overlap after we re-hashed
intersect(new_hash_key$Hash, b_new_hash_key$Hash)
intersect(new_hash_key$Hash, f_hash_key$Hash)
intersect(b_new_hash_key$Hash, f_hash_key$Hash)
intersect(b_new_hash_key$Sequence, f_hash_key$Sequence)
## YAY it works :) 

```
